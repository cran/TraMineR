Description: This package is a toolbox for sequence manipulation,
        description, rendering and more generally the mining of
        sequence data in the field of social sciences. Though it is
        primarily intended for analyzing state or event sequences that
        describe life courses such as family formation histories or
        professional careers its features also apply to many other
        kinds of categorical sequence data. It accepts many different
        sequence representations as input and provides tools for
        translating sequences from one format to another. It offers
        several statistical functions for describing and rendering
        sequences, for computing distances between sequences with
        different metrics among which optimal matching, the longest
        common prefix and the longest common subsequence, and simple
        functions for extracting the most frequent subsequences and
        identifying the most discriminating ones among them. A user's
        guide can be found on TraMineR's web page.
